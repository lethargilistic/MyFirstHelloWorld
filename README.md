# MyFirstHelloWorld
I decided to be a game developer when I was about 7, but I didn't take the first steps on that path until July 19, 2012,
when I sat down one night and followed a guide on Lifehacker about how to do some basic Javascipt. This HTML was the first
time I wrote HTML and it has sat on my parents' computer, where I was when I wrote it, for 6 years. It seems like I didn't
save the rest of the Javascript exercises I did that night, but that's OK. I'm happy to see this and the missing `</p>` tag.

This wasn't the first programming I *ever* did; I wrote the logic for RoboPRO robots in Mr. Jeff Scott's engineering classes
at Washington High School around 2009~2010. I worked on a marble sorter with John Hopkins and James Kaufman, as well as
a parachute drop with Alex "Keenan" Austin. I didn't think of that as real programming at the time. Make sure that the kid
appreciates that they are a real programmer when you're teaching them how to program.
